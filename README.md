publication descriptionIn this paper, we have proposed different deployment strategies and have applied area-wise clustering along with modified Ant Colony Optimization to minimize energy consumption.

Background: Previously some deployment strategies were used to enhance the lifetime of WSN. In our research, we have applied some novel deployment strategies like random, spiral, and S-pattern along with a novel area-wise clustering process to get better results than the existing literature as shown in Table 4.

Objective: The main objective of the research article is to enhance the lifetime of Wireless Sensor Network with the help of different deployment strategies like random, spiral, and S-pattern). A novel clustering process (i.e., area-wise clustering), and a Meta-heuristic algorithm (modified ACO) are applied.

Method: We have applied different methods for deployment strategies (random, spiral, and S-pattern). A novel clustering process (i.e., area-wise clustering), and a Meta-heuristic algorithm (modified ACO) are applied to get the desired results.

Results: Random Deployment: 11.15 days to 15.09 days. Spiral Deployment: 11.25 days to 15.23 days. S-Pattern Deployment: 11.33 days to 15.33 days.

Conclusion: In this paper, efficient Wireless Sensor Networks have been configured considering energy minimization as the prime concern. To minimize the energy consumption a modified ACO algorithm has been proposed. In our work, the minimization of energy consumption leads to an increment of the lifetime of WSN to a significant margin theoretically. The obtained result has been compared with the existing literature and it has been found that the proposed algorithm produced a better result than the existing literature.
